Growing up me and my siblings learned how to cook at an early age, starting with some basic dishes. So when I was older and going to school I always found it strange that most of my classmate could not cook. When I would ask them about that they would say that there, mostly, mother cooked or they had not learned to cook and take out is way faster. Cooking is not that difficult, if only I could help them figure that out.

When I finished school I decided to travel instead of study on and starting to work like all my classmates. While traveling I saw new cultures and new exiting foods and no idea how to make them. I made new friends from all over the world and I got to try some of there favorite dishes. I have asked how to make some of those dishes but I was not able to remember all of them and I did not have anywhere to write them down in a save place.

# UX

## Project Goals

- A way for people to have a save and structured place to write recipes. Where they are easy to access from anywhere in the world and the recipes are easy to find and shared with others.
- A way for friends to share recipes with each other in one place. Motivating them to try something different.
- A place for people to find inspiration on that question everyone asks him/her self every day what will I be eating today?

This project is aimed for everyone how is interested in cooking no mather the how good your cooking skills are. The layout of the website should be structured, easy to use and not to crowed/distracting. The website needs to be visually appealing enough to encourage user interaction whilst also provide an good User Experience to the every day chef.

### User Goals

- Easy to follow and well written recipes.
- Different kind of recipes/cuisines.
- Easy accessible and interactive from any device and on any type of internet.
- A secure place to put recipes.
- Clear images of the finished dish so they have an idea how it is going to look.
- finding tips to improve there cooking skills.

## User Requirements and Expectations

### Requirements

- Visible and working images to get an impression of dishes
- Navigation should make navigate the website easier.
- Login and register form need to be secure to help against hacking.
- Insert recipes form validation to help with incorrect display of dishes.

### Expectations

- Navigation takes user to specific parts of the website.
- Pop out nav appears in place of navbar on Tablet + Mobile Devices.
- Every recipe should have an image to give other user an idea how the dish looks like.
- Also every recipe should have a difficulty level and cooking time to make it easier to decide if it is achievable for other users.
- Form Validation works correctly.
- Login and register form are secured.
- Can click on Recipe name which displays the information needed to make the recipe.

## Design Choices

The theme of this project is food and there are a lot of websites like the one I am making for this project. So I wanted to do some research to see if there was anything that I could put in my design to make my website more appealing to users. And that would make users more likely to try and make some of the different recipes on my website.

### Fonts

I also looked in to the affects of different fonts and I found an article that talked about scientific facts about fonts. It states that "Experiments show that people are more likely to believe information set in Baskerville". People see Baskerville as a trustworthy font. So that would hopefully mean that users would be more likely to choose my website over another one. As there is a lot of competition in the segment.

So I went to look for this trustworthy font on Google fonts, turns out it is not available there. So for my primary font I went for the next best thing on Google fonts **Libre Baskerville**. I decided to go with the Regular 400. As the bold 700 would make it harder to read and the regular 400 italic could make it harder to follow instructions. As fact 3 in that same article says "The same researchers found that when people were given a task, those who got fancy fonts estimated the task would take nearly twice as long." I would not want to scare users off because they think the recipes take longer then estimated time.

The second font I wanted to be a bit mote fancy to draw users eyes to it. According to fact 2 in this article "Fancier fonts are associated with more skill in certain professions; in one study, diners who received menus with fancy fonts assumed the chef had more skill."

TIt cost me some time to find because I had to look through all 999 different family font, where I found 6 that I liked. After that I had to test the different fonts with my primary font. In the end I choose for the font family **Playball** as my second font, even though I find it a bit to bold. 

### Colours

I looked in to which colors would make people more likely to give them an appetite. From all the different articles that I have read I found out that the colours yellow, orange, green and red stimulate most peoples appetite. In some articles they also name the colour turquoise because it's often connected to happiness and the feeling of being carefree. 
The colours orange and yellow are the 2 that are seen as the colours that mostly only have positive effects on your appetite. 

- Yellow:
The color yellow makes most people very happy. When people are happy, they are more likely to eat than when they are feeling sad or overly calm.

- Orange:
Orange is a color that makes people feel welcome and when someone is comfortable, eating sounds like a great idea.

As for the colours red and green they have a positive effect but they can also have an increasing effect on your appetite. 

- Green:
Many people are attracted to the color green and associated it with abundance. This is a good color to promote healthy eating and lots of it. Some people associate green vegetables with a bitter or sour taste. The colour green is also calming effect and would help with eating an satisfying meal

- Red:
The color red raises a personâ€™s blood pressure, heart rate, and causes hunger to be more prevalent. Bit if you eat from a red plate you are more likely to eat less. They think it has to do with the fact that red is also a colour that is associated wit danger, warnings or stopping.

Therefor these are the four colours I am going to use in this project. The colours orange and yellow I will be using more primary and red and green I will be using to high lights.

### Styling

I want to keep the styling of the different pages simple and quite as I choose some bright and intense colours. The navbar will consists of two bright colours to get the attention of the users. The background of the different pages will stay white 

## Wireframes

I built the wireframes for this project using <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>. First I started by making a design for the desktop version, which I than translated to mobile/tablet version of the same design. I am not sure yet if I shoudl create a different design for tablet mode as now a days you have many different sizes for tablets. To get a better understanding of how the elements will be structured on the page.
